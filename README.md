# ML-practice-projects
Robo Garden bootcamp projects with data. 
This repository contains projects where I applied concepts I learnt during the class to variety of Kaggle data. Most projects are more about data investigation
and learning how to choose prediction and classification models and when chosen how to do hyperparameter tuning.
